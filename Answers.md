#1==> i have spent 18-20 hrs on this assignment. thogh I could not fulfill the sidebar and local storage due to some emergency but I gave my all efforts to this task.
temperature and all the fields are working inspite of sidebar that is left due to lack of time.

=========================================================================================================================================================================

#2==> If given a more time we can add more functionalities to this project. 
      Like by using current location of the device using navigator object which takes the longitude and latitutde to show current city location.
      Ofcourse the remaining functionalities of sidebar can be made possible and also the local storage can be added.

#3==Resume in JSON format
